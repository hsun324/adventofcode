# Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles of the Advent of Code
events that I have solved.

Many of the solutions published here are close the original working version.
As Advent of Code is a competitive programming competition, these solutions
are not written with standards of maintability in mind but rather to enable
quickly producing the solution requested of the problem and may reflect that
accordingly.
